"Issue Name","Issue Type","Issue Priority","URLs","% of Total","Description","How To Fix"
"Meta Description: Missing","Opportunity","Low","10","4.030","Pages which have a missing meta description, the content is empty or has a whitespace. This is a missed opportunity to communicate the benefits of your product or service and influence click through rates for important URLs.","It's important to write unique and descriptive meta descriptions on key pages to communicate the purpose of the page to users, and entice them to click on your result over the competition. It can also mean Google use this description for snippets in the search results for some queries, rather than make up their own based upon the content of the page."
"URL: Over 115 Characters","Opportunity","Low","84","22.830","URLs that are more than the configured length. This is generally not an issue, however research has shown that users prefer shorter, concise URL strings.","Where possible use logical and concise URLs for users and search engines. However, changing URLs is a big decision, and often it's not worth changing them for SEO purposes alone. If URLs are changed, then appropriate 301 redirects must be implemented."
"Page Titles: Below 200 Pixels","Opportunity","Medium","54","21.770","Pages which have page titles much shorter than Google's estimated pixel length limit. This isn't necessarily an issue, but it does indicate there might be room to target additional keywords or communicate your USPs.","Consider updating the page title to take advantage of the space left to include additional target keywords or USPs."
"H2: Duplicate","Opportunity","Low","236","95.160","Pages which have duplicate <h2>s. It's important to have distinct, unique and useful pages. If every page has the same <h2>, then it can make it more challenging for users and the search engines to understand one page from another.","Update duplicate <h2>s as necessary, so important pages contain a unique and descriptive <h2> for users and search engines.  If these are duplicate pages, then fix the duplicated pages by linking to a single version, and redirect or use canonicals where appropriate."
"Links: Pages With High External Outlinks","Warning","Low","20","8.060","Pages that have a high number of followed external outlinks on them based upon the 'High External Outlinks' preferences under 'Config > Spider > Preferences'. External outlinks are hyperlinks to another subdomain or domain (depending on your configuration). This might be completely valid, such as linking to another part of the same root domain, or linking to other useful websites. External followed outlinks can be seen in the 'Outlinks' tab, with the 'All Link Types' filter set to 'Hyperlinks' where the 'Follow' column is 'True'.","Review followed external outlinks to ensure they are to credible, trusted and relevant websites that are useful to your users."
"Security: Missing X-Frame-Options Header","Warning","Low","365","99.180","URLs missing an X-Frame-Options response header with a 'DENY' or 'SAMEORIGIN' value. This instructs the browser not to render a page within a frame, iframe, embed or object. This helps avoid 'clickjacking' attacks, where your content is displayed on another web page that is controlled by an attacker.","To minimise security issues, the X-Frame-Options response header should be supplied with a 'DENY' or 'SAMEORIGIN' value."
"Links: Pages Without Internal Outlinks","Warning","High","4","1.610","Pages that do not contain links to other internal pages. This can mean there are no links to other pages. However, it is also often due to the use of JavaScript, where links are not present in the raw HTML and are only in the rendered HTML after JavaScript has been processed. Enable JavaScript rendering mode ('Config > Spider > Rendering') to crawl pages with links that are only client-side in the rendered HTML. If there are no links that use an <a> tag with an href attribute to other internal pages, the search engines and the SEO Spider will have trouble discovering and indexing them.","Review the pages and whether there are links in the raw or rendered HTML. Switch to JavaScript rendering mode if links are only in the rendered HTML. While Google is able to render pages and see client-side only links, consider including important links server side in the raw HTML. For pages that simply don't link to any other internal pages, consider linking to other pages to help users continue in their journey and pass PageRank onwards."
"Meta Description: Over 985 Pixels","Opportunity","Low","71","28.630","Pages which have meta descriptions over Google's estimated pixel length limit for snippets. Google snippet length is actually based upon pixels limits, rather than a character length. The SEO Spider tries to match the latest pixel truncation points in the SERPs, but it is an approximation and Google adjusts them frequently.","Write concise meta descriptions to ensure important words are not truncated in the search results, and not visible to users."
"H2: Non-Sequential","Warning","Low","2","0.810","Pages with an <h2> that is not the second heading level after the <h1> on the page. Heading elements should be in a logical sequentially-descending order. The purpose of heading elements is to convey the structure of the page and they should be in logical order from <h1> to <h6>, which helps navigating the page and users that rely on assistive technologies.","Ensure the <h2> is the second heading on the page. Headings should be in a logical sequential order from <h1> to <h6>. Review and update page heading levels so they are descending in order, for example the heading element following an <h1> should be an <h2>, rather than an <h3>."
"Content: Readability Very Difficult","Opportunity","Low","1","0.400","Copy on the page is very difficult to read and best understood by university graduates according to the Flesch reading-ease score formula. Copy that has long sentences and uses complex words are generally harder to read and understand.","Consider improving the readability of copy for your target audience. Copy that uses shorter sentences with less complex words is often easier to read and understand."
"Response Codes: External Server Error (5xx)","Warning","Low","2","0.400","External URLs where the server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request. This can include common responses such as 500 Internal Server Errors and 503 Service Unavailable. View URLs that link to errors using the lower 'inlinks' tab and export them in bulk via 'Bulk Export > Response Codes > External > Server Error (5xx) inlinks'.","All URLs should respond with a 200 'OK' status and this might indicate a server that struggles under load, or a misconfiguration that requires investigation. If they can be viewed in a browser, then it's often not an issue."
"H1: Duplicate","Opportunity","Low","101","40.730","Pages which have duplicate <h1>s. It's important to have distinct, unique and useful main headings. If every page has the same <h1>, then it can make it more challenging for users and the search engines to understand one page from another.","Update duplicate <h1>s as necessary, so important pages contain a unique and descriptive <h1> for users and search engines.  If these are duplicate pages, then fix the duplicated pages by linking to a single version, and redirect or use canonicals where appropriate."
"Security: Missing Secure Referrer-Policy Header","Warning","Low","365","99.180","URLs missing 'no-referrer-when-downgrade', 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin', 'no-referrer' or 'strict-origin' policies in the Referrer-Policy header. When using HTTPS, it's important that the URLs do not leak in non-HTTPS requests. This can expose users to 'man in the middle' attacks, as anyone on the network can view them.","Consider setting a referrer policy of strict-origin-when-cross-origin. It retains much of the referrer's usefulness, while mitigating the risk of leaking data cross-origins."
"Meta Description: Duplicate","Opportunity","Low","132","53.230","Pages which have duplicate meta descriptions. It's really important to have distinct and unique meta descriptions that communicate the benefits and purpose of each page. If they are duplicate or irrelevant, then they will be ignored by search engines in their snippets.","Update duplicate meta descriptions as necessary, so important pages contain a unique and descriptive title for users and search engines. If these are duplicate pages, then fix the duplicated pages by linking to a single version, and redirect or use canonicals where appropriate."
"Content: Readability Difficult","Opportunity","Low","15","6.050","Copy on the page is difficult to read and best understood by college graduates according to the Flesch reading-ease score formula. Copy that has long sentences and uses complex words are generally harder to read and understand.","Consider improving the readability of copy for your target audience. Copy that uses shorter sentences with less complex words is often easier to read and understand."
"Security: Protocol-Relative Resource Links","Warning","Low","244","66.300","URLs that load resources such as images, JavaScript and CSS using protocol-relative links. A protocol-relative link is simply a link to a URL without specifying the scheme (for example, //screamingfrog.co.uk). It helps save developers time from having to specify the protocol and lets the browser determine it based upon the current connection to the resource. However, this technique is now an anti-pattern with HTTPS everywhere, and can expose some sites to 'man in the middle' compromises and performance issues","Update any resource links to be absolute links including the scheme (HTTPS) to avoid security and performance issues."
"Meta Description: Below 400 Pixels","Opportunity","Low","101","40.730","Pages which have meta descriptions much shorter than Google's estimated pixel length limit. This isn't necessarily an issue, but it does indicate there might be room to communicate benefits, USPs or call to actions.","Consider updating the meta description to take advantage of the space left to include additional benefits, USPs or call to actions to improve click through rates (CTR)."
"Images: Over 100 KB","Opportunity","Medium","9","20.450","Large images over a size threshold. Page speed is extremely important for users and SEO and often large resources such as images are one of the most common issues that slow down web pages. This filter simply acts as a general rule of thumb to help identify images that are fairly large in file size and may take longer to load. These should be considered for optimisation, alongside opportunities identified in the PageSpeed tab which uses the PSI API and Lighthouse to audit speed. This can help identify images that haven't been optimised in size, load offscreen, are unoptimised etc.","Uncompressed images bloat pages with unnecessary bytes, so ensure images are optimised with compression, properly scaled, and using the best image format to reduce file size where possible."
"Meta Description: Over 155 Characters","Opportunity","Low","75","30.240","Pages which have meta descriptions over the configured limit. Characters over this limit might be truncated in Google's search results.","Write concise meta descriptions to ensure important words are not truncated in the search results, and not visible to users."
"URL: Parameters","Warning","Low","147","39.950","URLs that include parameters such as '?' or '&'. This isn't an issue for Google or other search engines to crawl unless at significant scale, but it's recommended to limit the number of parameters in a URL which can be complicated for users, and can be a sign of low value-add URLs.","Where possible use a static URL structure without parameters for key indexable URLs. However, changing URLs is a big decision, and often it's not worth changing them for SEO purposes alone. If URLs are changed, then appropriate 301 redirects must be implemented."
"Security: Missing Content-Security-Policy Header","Warning","Low","365","99.180","URLs that are missing the Content-Security-Policy response header. This header allows a website to control which resources are loaded for a page. This policy can help guard against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks that exploit the browser's trust of the content received from the server. The SEO Spider only checks for existence of the header, and does not interrogate the policies found within the header to determine whether they are well set-up for the website. This should be performed manually.","Set a strict Content-Security-Policy response header across all page to help mitigate cross site scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks."
"H1: Missing","Issue","Medium","1","0.400","Pages which have a missing <h1>, the content is empty or has a whitespace. The <h1> should describe the main title and purpose of the page and are considered to be one of the stronger on-page ranking signals.","Ensure important pages have concise, descriptive and unique headings to help users, and enable search engines to score and rank the page for relevant search queries."
"Response Codes: External Client Error (4xx)","Warning","Low","4","0.800","External URLs with a client-side error. This indicates a problem occurred with the URL request and can include responses such as 400 bad request, 403 Forbidden, 404 Page Not Found, 410 Removed, 429 Too Many Requests and more. A 404 'Page Not Found' is the most common, and often referred to as a broken link. View URLs that link to errors using the lower 'inlinks' tab and export them in bulk via 'Bulk Export > Response Codes > External > Client Error (4xx) inlinks'.","All links on a website should ideally resolve to 200 'OK' URLs. Errors such as 404 broken links should be updated so users are taken to the correct URL, or removed. A 403 forbidden error occurs when a web server denies access to the SEO Spider's request and can often be resolved by switching the user-agent to Chrome via 'Config > User-Agent'. If they can be viewed in a browser, then it's often not an issue."
"Meta Description: Below 70 Characters","Opportunity","Low","101","40.730","Pages which have meta descriptions below the configured limit. This isn't strictly an issue, but an opportunity. There is additional room to communicate benefits, USPs or call to actions.","Consider updating the meta description to take advantage of the space left to include additional benefits, USPs or call to actions to improve click through rates (CTR)."
"Content: Low Content Pages","Opportunity","Medium","33","13.310","Pages with a word count that is below the default 200 words. The word count is based upon the content area settings used in the analysis which can be configured via 'Config > Content > Area'. There isn't a minimum word count for pages in reality, but the search engines do require descriptive text to understand the purpose of a page. This filter should only be used as a rough guide to help identify pages that might be improved by adding more descriptive content in the context of the website and page's purpose. Some websites, such as ecommerce, will naturally have lower word counts, which can be acceptable if a products details can be communicated efficiently.","Consider including additional descriptive content to help the user and search engines better understand the page."
"Links: Non-Descriptive Anchor Text In Internal Outlinks","Opportunity","Low","13","5.240","Pages that have internal outlinks with anchor text that is not descriptive, such as 'click here' or 'learn more' based upon the preferences under 'Config > Spider > Preferences'. Anchor text is the visible text and words used in hyperlinks that provide users and search engines context about the content of the target page. Internal outlinks with non-descriptive anchor text can be seen in the 'Outlinks' tab, with the 'All Link Types' filter set to 'Hyperlinks', where the 'Anchor Text' column has words such as 'click here', or 'learn more'. Export in bulk via 'Bulk Export > Links > Non-Descriptive Anchor Text In Internal Outlinks'.","Review the non-descriptive anchor text in outlinks and where appropriate update them to include useful and descriptive anchor text to help provide context to both users and search engines."
"Response Codes: Internal Client Error (4xx)","Issue","High","2","0.400","Internal URLs with a client-side error. This indicates a problem occurred with the URL request and can include responses such as 400 bad request, 403 Forbidden, 404 Page Not Found, 410 Removed, 429 Too Many Requests and more.

View URLs that link to errors using the lower 'inlinks' tab and export them in bulk via 'Bulk Export > Response Codes > Internal > Client Error (4xx) inlinks'.","All links on a website should ideally resolve to 200 'OK' URLs. Errors such as a 404 or 410 should be updated to their correct locations, removed and redirected where appropriate. A 403 forbidden error occurs when a web server denies access to the SEO Spider's request and can often be resolved by switching the user-agent to Chrome via 'Config > User-Agent' and crawling again."
"URL: Uppercase","Warning","Low","164","44.570","URLs that have uppercase characters within them. URLs are case sensitive, so as best practice generally URLs should be lowercase, to avoid any potential mix ups and duplicate URLs.","Ideally lowercase characters should be used for URLs only. However, changing URLs is a big decision, and often it's not worth changing them for SEO purposes alone. If URLs are changed, then appropriate 301 redirects must be implemented."
"Canonicals: Missing","Warning","Medium","240","96.770","Pages that have no canonical URL present either as a link element, or via HTTP header. If a page doesn't indicate a canonical URL, Google will identify what they think is the best version or URL. This can lead to ranking unpredictability when there are multiple versions discovered, and hence generally all URLs should specify a canonical version","Specify a canonical URL for every page to avoid any potential ranking unpredictability if multiple versions of the same page are discovered on different URLs."
"Images: Missing Alt Text","Issue","Low","35","79.550","Images that have an alt attribute, but are missing alt text. Click the address of the image and then the 'Image Details' tab in the lower window pane to view which pages have the image on them, and are missing alt text. Images should have descriptive alternative text about its purpose, which helps the blind and visually impaired, and the search engines understand it and its relevance to the web page.","Include descriptive alt text for images to help users and the search engines understand them better. Where possible, decorative images should be provided using CSS background images or alternatively a null (empty) alt text should be provided (alt="""") so that they can be ignored by assistive technologies, such as screen readers."
"Page Titles: Same as H1","Opportunity","Low","3","1.210","Page titles which match the h1 on the page exactly. This is not necessarily an issue, but may point to a potential opportunity to target alternative keywords, synonyms, or related key phrases.","This is not necessarily an issue, but may point to a potential opportunity to target alternative keywords, synonyms, or related key phrases."
"H1: Multiple","Warning","Medium","1","0.400","Pages which have multiple <h1>s. While this is not strictly an issue because HTML5 standards allow multiple <h1>s on a page, there are some problems with this modern approach in terms of usability. It's advised to use heading rank (h1-h6) to convey document structure. The classic HTML4 standard defines there should only be a single <h1> per page, and this is still generally recommended for users and SEO.","Consider updating the HTML to include a single <h1> on each page, and utilising the full heading rank between (h2 - h6) for additional headings."
"Page Titles: Below 30 Characters","Opportunity","Medium","85","34.270","Pages which have page titles under the configured limit. This isn't necessarily an issue, but it does indicate there might be room to target additional keywords or communicate your USPs.","Consider updating the page title to take advantage of the space left to include additional target keywords or USPs."
"H2: Multiple","Warning","Low","236","95.160","Pages which have multiple <h2>s. This is not an issue as HTML standards allow multiple <h2>'s when used in a logical hierarchical heading structure. However, this filter can help you quickly scan to review if they are used appropriately.","Ensure <h2>s are used in a logical hierarchical heading structure, and update where appropriate utilising the full heading rank between (h3 - h6) for additional headings."
"Page Titles: Over 60 Characters","Opportunity","Medium","68","27.420","Pages which have page titles that exceed the configured limit. Characters over this limit might be truncated in Google's search results and carry less weight in scoring.","Write concise page titles to ensure important words are not truncated in the search results, not visible to users and potentially weighted less in scoring."
"Security: Unsafe Cross-Origin Links","Warning","Low","44","11.960","URLs that link to external websites using the target=""_blank"" attribute (to open in a new tab), without using rel=""noopener"" (or rel=""noreferrer"") at the same time. Using target=""_blank"" alone leaves those pages exposed to both security and performance issues for some legacy browsers, which are estimated to be below 5% of market share. Setting target=""_blank"" on <a> elements implicitly provides the same rel behavior as setting rel=""noopener"" which does not set window.opener for most modern browsers, such as Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Edge.  The external links that contain the target=""_blank"" attribute by itself can be viewed in the 'outlinks' tab and 'target' column. They can be exported alongside the pages they are linked from via 'Bulk Export > Security > Unsafe Cross-Origin Links'.","Consider the benefits of including the rel=""noopener"" link attribute on any links that contain the target=""_blank"" attribute to avoid security and performance issues for the users of legacy browsers that may visit the website."
"Response Codes: Internal Redirection (3xx)","Warning","Low","1","0.200","Internal URLs which redirect to another URL. These will include server-side redirects, such as 301 or 302 redirects (and more). View URLs that link to redirects using the lower 'inlinks' tab and export them in bulk via 'Bulk Export > Response Codes > Internal > Redirection (3xx) inlinks'.","Ideally all internal links would be to canonical resolving URLs, and avoid linking to URLs that redirect. This reduces latency of redirect hops for users, and enhanced efficiency for search engines."
"Security: Missing X-Content-Type-Options Header","Warning","Low","365","99.180","URLs that are missing the 'X-Content-Type-Options' response header with a 'nosniff' value. In the absence of a MIME type, browsers may 'sniff' to guess the content type to interpret it correctly for users. However, this can be exploited by attackers who can try and load malicious code, such as JavaScript via an image they have compromised.","To minimise security issues, the X-Content-Type-Options response header should be supplied and set to 'nosniff'. This instructs browsers to rely only on the Content-Type header and block anything that does not match accurately. This also means the content-type set needs to be accurate."
"Links: Internal Outlinks With No Anchor Text","Opportunity","Low","51","20.560","Pages that have internal links without anchor text or images that are hyperlinked without alt text. Anchor text is the visible text and words used in hyperlinks that provide users and search engines context about the content of the target page. Internal outlinks without anchor text can be seen in the 'Outlinks' tab, with the 'All Link Types' filter set to 'Hyperlinks', where the 'Anchor Text' column is blank, or if an image, the 'Alt Text' column is also blank. Export in bulk via 'Bulk Export > Links > Internal Outlinks With No Anchor Text'.","Review the missing anchor text outlinks and where appropriate include useful and descriptive anchor text to help users and search engines."
"URL: GA Tracking Parameters","Warning","Low","2","0.540","URLs that contain Google Analytics tracking parameters. In addition to creating duplicate pages that must be crawled, using tracking parameters on links internally can overwrite the original session data. utm= parameters strip the original source of traffic and starts a new session with the specified attributes. _ga= and _gl= parameters are used for cross-domain linking and identify a specific user, including this on links prevents a unique user ID from being assigned.","Remove the tracking parameters from links. Event Tracking is recommended in place of utm parameters for tracking additional interactions on a page such as downloads, link clicks, form submissions, and video plays."
"Page Titles: Over 561 Pixels","Opportunity","Medium","60","24.190","Pages which have page titles over Google's estimated pixel length limit for titles in search results. Google snippet length is actually based upon pixels limits, rather than a character length. The SEO Spider tries to match the latest pixel truncation points in the SERPs, but it is an approximation and Google adjusts them frequently.","Write concise page titles to ensure important words are not truncated in the search results, not visible to users and potentially weighted less in scoring."
"H1: Over 70 Characters","Opportunity","Low","16","6.450","Pages which have <h1>s over the configured length. There is no hard limit for characters in an <h1>, however they should be clear and concise for users and long headings might be less helpful","Write concise <h1>s for users, including target keywords where natural for users - without keyword stuffing."
"URL: Underscores","Opportunity","Low","2","0.540","URLs with underscores, which are not always seen as word separators by search engines.","Ideally hyphens should be used as word separators, rather than underscores. However, changing URLs is a big decision, and often it's not worth changing them for SEO purposes alone. If URLs are changed, then appropriate 301 redirects must be implemented."
"H2: Missing","Warning","Low","4","1.610","Pages which have a missing <h2>, the content is empty or has a whitespace. The <h2> heading is often used to describe sections or topics within a document. They act as signposts for the user, and can help search engines understand the page.","Consider using logical and descriptive <h2>s on important pages that help the user and search engines better understand the page."
"H1: Non-Sequential","Warning","Low","236","95.160","Pages with an <h1> that is not the first heading on the page. Heading elements should be in a logical sequentially-descending order.

"Directives: Noindex","Warning","High","8","2.190","URLs containing a 'noindex' directive in either a robots meta tag or X-Robots-Tag in the HTTP header. This instructs the search engines not to index the page. The page will still be crawled (to see the directive), but it will then be dropped from the index.","URLs with a 'noindex' should be reviewed carefully to ensure they are correct and shouldn't be indexed. If these pages should be indexed, then the 'noindex' directive should be removed."
"Page Titles: Duplicate","Opportunity","Medium","88","35.480","Pages which have duplicate page titles. It's really important to have distinct and unique page titles for every page. If every page has the same page title, then it can make it more challenging for users and the search engines to understand one page from another.","Update duplicate page titles as necessary, so each page contains a unique and descriptive title for users and search engines.

"Images: Missing Size Attributes","Opportunity","Low","44","100.000","Image elements without dimensions (width and height size attributes) specified in the HTML. This can cause large layout shifts as the page loads and be frustrating experience for users. It is one of the major reasons that contributes to a high Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS).","Define all image sizes as their native size using width and height attributes in the HTML. This allows the browser to calculate enough space for each image before it loads, avoiding large layout shifts."
